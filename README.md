## About



## Set-up

### Cloning the respository

If you want to work with this repository locally you will need to clone it onto your local machine. To do this, navigate to where in your file system you want the repository to be saved in the command line, and run the following command: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhiggins285/mah-games
```

### Installing dependencies

This repository makes use of a few other packages that you will need to install before it is able to run locally.

To make sure you have all of these installed, run the following command when you first open the repository:

```bash
npm i
```

### Running the app

To run the app within your browser, first run the command below:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, you will need to press the 'd' key in order to open up the developer tools, upon which you will see the option to run the app within your browser, however, as the app is optimised for mobile use, and some of the features are unavailable within browser, we recommend instead running on mobile.

To run on mobile, first follow the steps above, but upon reaching the developer tools, click the button that says "tunnel". You will then need to download the "Expo Go" app onto your smartphone (both iOS and Android devices are compatible). Upon the downloading the app, use it to scan the QR code that appears on the developer tools screen of Expo, and then, after compiling and downloading, the app should be available within the Expo Go app to use, though you must ensure that the Tunnel is active through your developer tools throughout.

This should also allow you the see the effect of changes you make to the code live as you make them.

## System requirements

You will need to install Node v16.9.1 to run this repository.
